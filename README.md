# JS-Calculator - A Scientific Calculator Using JavaScript

This is a **scientific calculator** built using **JavaScript**, designed to provide all the basic mathematical operations, as well as advanced features to store and recall values in memory.

## Features

### Basic Operations:
- **Addition (+):** Adds two or more numbers.
- **Subtraction (-):** Subtracts the second operand from the first.
- **Multiplication (*):** Multiplies two or more numbers.
- **Division (/):** Divides the first operand by the second.
- **Modulus (%):** Returns the remainder of the division between two numbers.

### Advanced Operations:
- **Parentheses ( () ):** Groups numbers and operations together for proper calculation order (PEMDAS). This handles nested parentheses and ensures the correct order of operations.
- **Decimal ( . ):** Adds a decimal point to the current value. You can only add one decimal point per operand, and multiple decimal points will be prevented until an operator is inserted between operands.

### Memory Functions:
- **MS (Memory Store):** Stores the current display value in memory.
- **MC (Memory Clear):** Clears the stored memory.
- **MR (Memory Recall):** Recalls the stored memory value and displays it.
- **M+ (Memory Add):** Adds the current display value to the stored memory value.
- **M- (Memory Subtract):** Subtracts the current display value from the stored memory value.

### Keyboard Support:
- You can also perform calculations using the keyboard. Simply type the numbers and operators directly into the calculator's input field.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Basic Operations:**  
   Enter numbers and use the operators (+, -, *, /, %) to perform calculations.
   
2. **Use Parentheses for Complex Calculations:**  
   Group your expressions using parentheses to define the correct order of operations.

3. **Memory Functions:**  
   - **MS (Memory Store):** Store a value in memory by clicking the "MS" button.
   - **MC (Memory Clear):** Clear the stored memory using "MC".
   - **MR (Memory Recall):** Recall the value stored in memory using the "MR" button.
   - **M+ (Memory Add):** Add the current value to the stored memory by clicking "M+".
   - **M- (Memory Subtract):** Subtract the current value from the stored memory using "M-".

4. **Decimal Point:**  
   Use the **dot (.)** to add a decimal point to a number. You can only use one decimal point per operand.

## Example Calculations:

- **Basic Addition:**  
  `5 + 3 = 8`

- **Power two:**  
  `(0 ^ 2) = 0`
  `(2 ^ 2) = 4`


- **Parentheses for Order of Operations:**  
  `(3 + 2) * 4 = 20`

- **Memory Operations Example:**  
  1. Enter `10` and click "MS" (Memory Store).
  2. Enter `5`, then click "M+" to add it to the memory.
  3. Click "MR" to recall the memory value, which will now be `15` (10 + 5).

## Keyboard Shortcuts

You can also use the keyboard for your calculations:
- **Numbers (0-9)**: Input digits directly.
- **Operators (+, -, *, /, %)**: Use these operators to perform calculations.
- **Decimal (.)**: Use the period (.) key to add a decimal point to your number.
